<p><tt>Robotexclusionrulesparser</tt> is a BSD-licensed 
alternative to and improvement on
the Python standard library module <tt>robotparser</tt>.
You can download the full package (containing documentation, unit
tests, etc.) or just the individual module.</p>

<p><tt>Robotexclusionrulesparser</tt> runs under Python 
2.4 &ndash; 3.2. It hasn't been tested with Python ≤ 2.4, or &gt; 3.2, but
it might work with those versions.
</p>

<p>Full package:
<a href="robotexclusionrulesparser-1.6.1.tar.gz">robotexclusionrulesparser-1.6.1.tar.gz</a> 
<a href="robotexclusionrulesparser-1.6.1.md5.txt">[md5 sum]</a>
</p>
<p>Just the module: 
    <a href="robotexclusionrulesparser-1.6.1.py">robotexclusionrulesparser-1.6.1.py</a>
</p>

<p>This documentation refers to three similar-but-different robots.txt 
standards called MK1994, MK1996 and GYM2008. In short, the first two
comprise the traditional robots.txt standard and the last describes some
extensions. There's <a href="#standards">details about these
robots.txt standards below</a>.
</p>

<h3>Differences Between <tt>robotexclusionrulesparser</tt> and Python's <tt>robotparser</tt></h3>

<p>This module offers a class (<tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt>) that
is a functional drop-in replacement for the standard library's
<tt>robotparser.RobotFileParser</tt>. You can also use the slightly nicer
but different interface exposed by the class 
<tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt>. Both classes differ from the 
Python standard library module as desrcibed below.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>This module understands the 
        <a href="#gym2008">GYM2008</a> syntax.</strong> GYM2008 
        is shorthand for the robots.txt syntax extensions (path wildcards,
        the <tt>Crawl-delay</tt> directive and the <tt>Sitemap</tt> directive)
        agreed upon by 
        <b>G</b>oogle, <b>Y</b>ahoo and <b>M</b>icrosoft in 2008. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>This module accepts non-ASCII characters in
        robots.txt.</strong> It decodes the file
        with the encoding specified in the HTTP Content-type header sent with robots.txt file.
        If no encoding is specified, it defaults to ISO-8859-1 per the HTTP specs.
    </li>
    <li><strong>This module implements the "Expiration" section
        of MK1996.</strong> Specifically, it looks for an
        HTTP Expires header when fetching robots.txt. If it finds one, it stores that expiration
        date. Otherwise it uses the MK1996 default of one week. The function
        <tt>is_expired()</tt> makes use of this date; see <a href="#usage">the
        usage notes</a> for more information. Consequently, this module dispenses with the
        <tt>modified()</tt> and <tt>mtime()</tt> functions provided by
        <tt>robotparser</tt>. However, I deliberately left the instance variable
        <tt>expiration_date</tt> easily accessible in case you want to mess with it.
    </li>
    <li><strong>This module handles HTTP fetching errors differently
        than <tt>robotparser</tt>.</strong> MK1996 is mostly non-committal on this topic, so
        handling of these codes is somewhat implementation dependent. IMHO,
        <tt>robotparser</tt> complies with the letter but not the spirit of MK1996 with
        regards to handling error codes. MK1996 says, "On the request attempt resulted in
        temporary failure [<i>sic</i>] a robot should defer visits to the site until such
        time as the resource can be retrieved". It also says that that "is not required...[but
        is] recommended". <tt>robotparser</tt> handles those errors internally (e.g. a 503
        Service Unavailable is interpreted as "allow all");
        this module punts such errors up to the caller so that she can
        decide how to handle them.
    </li>
    <li>There's a bug in <tt>robotparser</tt>'s handling of robots.txt <strong>files that
        contain a BOM (byte order mark)</strong>. It doesn't make any accomodation for them, so
        it might see the first line of a robots.txt file with a UTF-8 BOM as this:<br>
        <tt>&#xef;&#xbb;&#xbf;User-agent: foobot</tt>

        <p>The bug can have significant consequences when robots.txt consists of this:<br>
           <tt>[BOM]User-agent: *<br>
           Disallow: /
           </tt><br>
           The user-agent line will be seen as garbage and so the disallow rule will be
           ignored. The result will be that all robots will be permitted everywhere which is
           the exact opposite of what the robots.txt author intended.
        </p>

        <p>This module doesn't get confused by BOMs; it simply ignores them.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>This module adds a user_agent attribute</strong> that,
        if populated, is sent in lieu of Python's user agent when fetching robots.txt from
        the Web.
    </li>
    <li>This module's <tt>parse()</tt> function accepts a
        string; that string can be Unicode. If it isn't Unicode, it's converted
        to Unicode using ISO-8859-1.
    </li>
    <li><strong>This module adds a <tt>response_code</tt> attribute</strong> that 
        reports (what else?) the response code when a robots.txt file is fetched from a 
        remote server.
    </li>
    <li>This module accepts "user-agent" or "useragent" as being
        valid in robots.txt. The spec permits only the former.
    </li>
    <li>There's a bug in <tt>robotparser</tt>'s handling of paths that contain a %-encoded
        forward slash; MK1996 says that they shouldn't be translated but the robotparser module
        does. This module replaces that bug with newer, more interesting bugs. =)
    </li>
</ol>


<h3 id="usage">Usage - General</h3>

<p>The module has two classes: <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> and
<tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt>. The latter offers all the features
of the former and also bolts on an API that makes it a drop-in replacement for 
the standard library's <tt>robotparser.RobotFileParser</tt>.
</p>

<p>The module defines the constants <tt>MK1996</tt> and <tt>GYM2008</tt>
which refer to the different syntaxes that this module understands. MK1996 
is the traditional syntax; GYM2008 respects wildcards in paths.
</p>


<h3>Usage - Class <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt></h3>

<p>A <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> instance has five functions and 
five attributes. The most common usage is to call <tt>fetch()</tt> to set up the 
parser and then call <tt>is_allowed()</tt>. If your code is long-running, 
you'll also want to call <tt>is_expired()</tt> occasionally. Everything 
else is non-essential. The constructor takes no parameters.
</p>

<h4>Functions</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>fetch(url, timeout=None)</dt>
    <dd>Fetch robots.txt from the URL provided and parse it. This method sets
        the <tt>expiration_date</tt> and <tt>source_url</tt> attributes.

        <p>The timeout (supported under Python &gt; 2.5) is a float measured in
        seconds. If a timeout occurs, <tt>urllib2.URLError</tt> is raised under 
        Python 2 and <tt>socket.timeout</tt> under Python 3.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>parse(content)</dt>
    <dd>Parse a string representing the content of a robots.txt file. This is 
        useful if your robots.txt file isn't
        HTTP-accessible, or if you just want to experiment. The unit tests make
        heavy use of this function.
    </dd>

    <dt>is_allowed(user_agent, url, syntax=GYM2008)</dt>
    <dd>Return a boolean indicating whether or not the given user agent is allowed to visit
            the URL. The user agents listed in robots.txt only need be present as a substring in
            the UserAgent parameter for this function to match them; the comparison is
            case-insensitive.
        <p>For instance, passing a <tt>user_agent</tt> of <tt>Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
            Foobot/2.1)</tt> would match the user agent rule <tt>foobot</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>The scheme and authority are discarded from the URL when comparing it to robots.txt
            rules. (e.g. <tt>http://www.example.com/foo/bar.html</tt> becomes
            <tt>/foo/bar.html</tt>.) This is the way you want it to work -- the rules in
            robots.txt don't specify scheme and authority themselves, so one can't match against
            them.
        </p>
        
        <p>The syntax parameter must be one of <tt>GYM2008</tt> (the default)
            or <tt>MK1996</tt>. The former indicates that the module should 
            respect wildcards while the latter indicates that <tt>*</tt> and
            <tt>$</tt> should be treated as literals.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>is_expired()</dt>
    <dd><p>Return a boolean indicating whether or not the parser has passed its expiration
            date (the dreaded "not-so-fresh" feeling). The expiration date is set when you
            call <tt>fetch()</tt> either by reading the HTTP Expires header or by using
            a default of seven days. See also the related attributes
            <tt>expiration_date</tt> and <tt>use_local_time</tt>.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>get_crawl_delay(user_agent)</dt>
    <dd>Returns the crawl delay for this user agent as a float, or <tt>None</tt>
        if no crawl delay is defined.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>user_agent</dt>
    <dd>Send this user agent string to the server when fetching robots.txt. If left blank,
        Python's default is used.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>source_url</dt>
    <dd>This read-only attribute reports the URL that you used in the most recent call
        to <tt>fetch()</tt>. This is useful when the
        parser's expiration date passes because you can simply call
        <tt>parser.fetch(parser.source_url)</tt> to refresh the parser.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>use_local_time</dt>
    <dd>A boolean that tells <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> whether
        <tt>expiration_date</tt> should be in local time or UTC (a.k.a. Greenwich
        Mean Time).
        Since <tt>expiration_date</tt> is set when you call <tt>fetch()</tt>, you
        must set <tt>use_local_time</tt> <strong>before</strong> calling
        <tt>fetch()</tt> for it to have any effect.

        <p>If you only call <tt>is_expired()</tt> and never look at
        <tt>expiration_date</tt>, you can leave <tt>use_local_time</tt> at its
        default (True).
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>expiration_date</dt>
    <dd>A timestamp that states when the robots.txt contents are out of date. The timestamp
        is a Unix-style timestamp; i.e. a float counting the number of seconds since the
        epoch. The function <tt>is_expired()</tt> will compare this to "now" for you.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>response_code</dt>
    <dd>The response code received during the last fetch from a remote server, or <tt>None</tt>
        if fetch has not been called. When using Python &le; 2.3, this information is
        less precise. It is set to 200 if the fetch is successful or None otherwise. (Older
        versions of Python don't provide this information and so I have to fake it.)
        
        <p>This attribute is read-only.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>sitemap</dt>
    <dd>Deprecated. Use <tt>sitemaps</tt> instead.</dd>

    <dt>sitemaps</dt>
    <dd>A list of the sitemap URLs defined in the robots.txt. This module 
        simply reports the data it found after the <tt>Sitemap</tt> directives.
        No guarantees are made about
        whether or not the URLs exist or are valid URLs. 
        
        <p>This attribute is read-only and defaults to an empty list.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Usage - Class <tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt></h3>

<p><tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt> is a drop-in replacement for 
the standard library module, so I refer you to 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/robotparser.html">the documentation
for <tt>robotparser.RobotFileParser</tt> for API details</a>. 
Only differences from the standard library module are mentioned below.
</p>

<h4>Functional Differences</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>can_fetch(useragent, url, syntax=GYM2008)</dt>
    <dd>The <tt>syntax</tt> argument is not present in the standard library
        version.
    </dd>

    <dt>mtime()</dt>
    <dd>The <tt>robotparser</tt> documentation says that this function, 
        "Returns the time the robots.txt file was last fetched". This isn't
        true, though. It actually returns the last time <tt>modified()</tt> 
        was called. Furthermore, it's up to the caller to call 
        <tt>modified()</tt>; it's not called automatically when one calls 
        <tt>RobotFileParser.read()</tt>. 
        
        <p>In other words, unless one calls <tt>modified()</tt>, 
            <tt>mtime()</tt> will always return <tt>0</tt>.
        </p>
        
        <p>This module's <tt>mtime()</tt> method mimics the <em>behavior</em>
        of the standard library module, not its documentation.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Attribute Differences</h4>

<p><tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt> exposes <tt>last_checked</tt> but
none of <tt>entries</tt>, <tt>default_entry</tt>, <tt>disallow_all</tt>
or <tt>allow_all</tt>.
</p>


<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Users of this module should be aware that it raises a few exceptions. Some of them
are impossible to finesse internally (Unicode errors, for instance). Others are deliberately
exposed because handling them is outside of the scope of the robots.txt specifications and
thus outside of the scope of this module. (If, for instance, a robots.txt is present but an
error occurs during its transmission.)
</p>

<p><strong>The first exception explicitly raised by this code is a Unicode exception</strong>
(some flavor of <tt>UnicodeError</tt>). You
can see that in two different situations. First, if the parser fetches a robots.txt file that
can't be
decoded using the encoding specified in the HTTP response header. (That encoding defaults to
ISO-8859-1 which is a superset of US-ASCII which is what &gt; 99.9% of existing robots.txt
files use.) Second, you'll see a Unicode exception
if you feed a non-Unicode string (i.e. <tt>isinstance(YourString, unicode) ==
False</tt>) to <tt>parse()</tt> and that string can't be decoded using ISO-8859-1.
</p>

<p><strong>The second exception explicitly raised by this code is a urllib2.URLError
exception.</strong> <tt>fetch()</tt>
uses <tt>urllib2.urlopen()</tt> and if that function raises an exception, the
exception is passed up to the caller after being massaged to make it a little nicer to deal
with.
</p>

<p>Note that not all non-200 response codes raise an exception. Those for which MK1996 defines
specific actions are handled internally&nbsp;&ndash;
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Anything in the range 200 - 299 is treated as "OK".</li>
    <li>Redirections (30x codes) are handled automagically by urllib2.</li>
    <li>401 and 403 mean everything is disallowed.</li>
    <li>404 means everything is allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> raises a URLError exception that the caller
decides isn't fatal (e.g. the response code 410 Gone), she can just call
<tt>parser.parse("")</tt> and use the parser as normal.
</p>

<p>Note that although urllib2 handles most redirects by itself, urllib2 can return 301/302 as
the response code if the server generates
an infinite loop of 301/302 redirects. Users of this module should be prepared to handle that
response code.
</p>

<p><strong>These aren't the only exceptions that you might see</strong>, they're just the ones that
the code raises explicitly. Another likely source for exceptions is the
<tt>unicode()</tt> function. The function <tt>fetch()</tt> gets the encoding from
the Content-Type header that comes with the robots.txt file. That encoding gets passed directly
to <tt>unicode()</tt>. When I first started using <tt>unicode()</tt> I naïvely
expected that an encoding Python didn't understand would be bounced back as a LookupError.
Apparently I wasn't alone in thinking
that; <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue960874">Python
bug 960874</a> was filed for that reason. But it was closed as no bug/no fix with the
explanation that, <q>it is not guaranteed that you will only see LookupErrors (the same is
true for most other Python APIs, e.g. most can generate MemoryErrors). Possible other errors
are ValueErrors, NameErrors, ImportErrors, etc. etc.</q>. Explanations like this make me
long for a construct like Java's <tt>throws</tt> keyword. <tt>:-/</tt>
</p>

<p>You also need to watch out for a variety of exceptions from <tt>fetch()</tt> because it
calls urllib2 which calls httplib which calls socket. I repackage some of the exceptions
but others get raised up to the caller untouched. Experience has taught me to watch out
for
<tt>httplib.BadStatusLine</tt>, <tt>socket.error</tt> and <tt>socket.timeout</tt>.
You also need to handle <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue900744">Python bug 900744</a> 
which causes httplib to raise ValueError in some cases. This affects
Python 2.4 but not 2.3. AFAIK there is no workaround other than to apply the patch supplied.
</p>

<p>Last but not least, there's <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue1591774">a bug in 
urllib2 that raises <tt>OSError</tt></a> on rare occasions. This has been fixed but
as of Python 2.5.1 the patch has not yet been integrated.
</p>


<h3>A Simple Example</h3>

<p>For extensive examples, see <a href="parser_test.py">parser_test.py</a>.</p>

<pre>
    import robotexclusionrulesparser

    rerp = robotexclusionrulesparser.RobotExclusionRulesParser()

    # I'll set the (optional) user_agent before calling fetch.
    rerp.user_agent = "Foobot/2.1 (See http://example.net/foobot.html for info)"

    # Note that there should be a try/except here to handle urllib2.URLError,
    # socket.timeout, UnicodeError, etc.
    rerp.fetch("http://www.example.org/robots.txt")
    
    user_agents_and_urls = [ ("Foobot", "/index.html"), ("Barbot", "/") ]

    for user_agent, url in user_agents_and_urls:
        print "Can %s fetch '%s'? %s" % \
            (user_agent, url, rerp.is_allowed(user_agent, url))
</pre>



<h3 id="standards">Compliance with Published Specifications</h3>

<p>
"Does it comply with the spec?" is a trick question in this case; there is no real spec.
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/norobots-rfc.txt">The most recent formal robots.txt
format proposal</a> was published in 1996 (urk!) and that was only a draft which was
never sanctified. (It says clearly at the top, "It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts
as reference material...") Even specs that have gone through a full review and comment process
can be open to interpretation, so it's no surprise that the robots.txt draft spec has some
holes. Actually, it is surprisingly complete, considering.
</p>

<p>In addition, 
<a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/06/improving-on-robots-exclusion-protocol.html">Google</a>, 
<a href="http://ysearchblog.com/2008/06/03/one-standard-fits-all-robots-exclusion-protocol-for-yahoo-google-and-microsoft/">Yahoo</a>
and 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/webmaster/archive/2008/06/03/robots-exclusion-protocol-joining-together-to-provide-better-documentation.aspx">Microsoft</a>
announced in 2008 that they would jointly support extensions to the robots.txt syntax.
Although a set of blog postings feels even a less official than an 
unblessed draft RFC, this syntax is quickly becoming the <em>de facto</em> 
standard. 
</p>

<p><strong>I refer to
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html">Martijn Koster's 
relatively well-known 1994 document</a> as MK1994, 
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/norobots-rfc.txt">his lesser-known but
more formal 1996 draft spec</a> as
MK1996, and the Google-Yahoo-Microsoft syntax as GYM2008.</strong>
</p>

<p>
This module implements all of MK1994, MK1996 and GYM2008. In particular, 
it supports the following lesser-known parts of MK1994/96:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Both Allow: and Disallow: fields.</li>
    <li>Any style end-of-line marker (\r, \n or \r\n).</li>
    <li>Decoding %-encoded octets.</li>
    <li>Expiration according to the timestamp in the HTTP Expires header sent with robots.txt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The vast majority of robots.txt tutorials and the like make no mention of 
the features introduced in MK1996 (like Allow: fields) or wrongly attribute
them to GYM2008. Furthermore, many insist that end-of-line markers
must be Unix-style <tt>\n</tt> even though it is clearly stated in MK1994 
and MK1996 that <tt>\r</tt>, <tt>\n</tt> and <tt>\r\n</tt> are 
all acceptable. Even such luminaries as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q217103/">Microsoft</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#h-B.4.1.1">the W3C</a>
seem unaware of MK1996, although they are willing
to quote the older and less formal MK1994. Hrrmph.
</p>


<h4 id="gym2008">GYM2008</h4>

<p>GYM2008 consists of three small extensions to MK1994/96. 
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=40360">Google 
describes two of them here</a> but you'll have to 
<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/webcrawler/slurp-03.html">visit
Yahoo for an explanation of Crawl-delay</a>.
</p>

<p>Two of the three GYM2008 extensions are harmless. The
Crawl-delay and Sitemap directives are ignored by older parsers and are
a useful addition to the standard. 
</p>

<p>The GYM2008 allowance for path wildcards is less benign because it
breaks parsers that obey MK1994/96. For instance, consider the following
robots.txt:
</p>

<pre>
   User-agent: *
   Disallow: *
</pre>

<p>The User-agent line is valid in both MK1994/96 and GYM2008; it means simply 
"all user agents". 
But the Disallow path wildcard is specific to GYM2008 syntax. In the traditional 
MK1994/96 syntax, all paths are treated literally, so this robots.txt
says that only the file with the unlikely name '*' is disallowed. 
Under GYM2008 syntax rules, <em>all</em> files are disallowed.
</p>

<p>This problem is exacerbated by the fact that many new Webmasters adopt 
the GYM2008 syntax without realizing that it is relatively new and in 
conflict with the 
traditional syntax. As a result, if a bot that's been behaving perfectly
well for 10+ years encounters a robots.txt like the one above,
it may assume (correctly!) that it is permitted access to all files on the 
site although the Webmaster assumes just the opposite. The Webmaster will
assume that the bot is ill-behaved and may go so far as to ban it.
</p>

<p>This module defaults to GYM2008 syntax. This is unlikely to cause problems
because the characters that GYM2008 reserves for special treatment 
(<tt>*</tt> and <tt>$</tt>) are unlikely to occur as path literals. 
In other words, a GYM2008-aware parser like this one is extremely unlikely to 
misinterpret a robots.txt written to MK1994/96 standards. Note that the
reverse is not true – it's very likely that a parser unaware of GYM2008 will 
misinterpret the intent of a robots.txt that uses GYM2008-specific syntax.
</p>

<h3>My Extensions to Published Specifications</h3>

<p>In the spirit of "be generous in what you accept", this module also handles some things
that are invalid according to the specs.
</p>

<p>First, <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> accepts "user-agent" or "useragent" in robots.txt
whereas MK1994/96 only permit the former.
</p>

<p>The second and most signficant exception this module permits is the presence of non-ASCII
characters in the significant fields of robots.txt. ("Significant"
here means "anything outside of a comment".)  MK1994 doesn't address the subject of
non-ASCII or encodings, but MK1996 (in Section 3.3, "Formal Syntax")
makes it clear that only ASCII characters are allowed in significant
fields. (Side note &ndash; actually only a subset of printable ASCII characters are allowed;
but you'll have to read the spec yourself to get the gory details.)
</p>

<p>Despite what MK1996 says, 
<a href="http://NikitaTheSpider.com/articles/RobotsTxt.html">a survey of real-world robots.txt files</a>
shows that about one in every thousand includes non-ASCII in significant fields. Python's
<tt>robotparser</tt> module rolls over and dies when it encounters these. In
contrast, this module
attempts to decode the file using (a) the encoding specified in the HTTP Content-Type header
sent with robots.txt (if present, which is rare) or (b) a default of ISO-8859-1 as per the
HTTP spec RFC 2616. This solves the encoding problems for nearly all non-ASCII robots.txt files.
</p>

<h3>Non-compliance with Published Specifications</h3>

<p>MK1996 contradicts MK1994 somewhat. MK1994 (which only defines
disallows) says that a blank path indicates nothing is disallowed. MK1996 (which
defines both allows and disallows) doesn't permit blank paths (the minimal path is a
single slash: <tt>/</tt>) but
doesn't mention anything about this change in the section on backwards compatibility. AFAIK
blank paths are still widely used in Disallow lines which is consistent with the fact that
most of the Net seems to ignore MK1996 and regard MK1994 as the <i>de facto</i> standard.
</p>

<p>In the absence of other guidance, this code interprets blank disallow lines as
meaning nothing is disallowed and for consistency interprets blank allow lines as meaning
nothing is allowed. Thus, these two rules mean the same thing:
</p>

<pre>
        # Disallow everything
        User-agent: foobot
        Disallow: /

        # Allow nothing
        User-agent: foobot
        Allow:
</pre>


<h3>Version History</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Current &ndash; 1.6.1 (1 September 2012)</strong> &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a couple of Python 2/3 bugs related to converting parsers
            containing non-ASCII to strings (using <tt>str()</tt> or 
            <tt>unicode()</tt>). These didn't affect rule evaluation.
            </li>

            <li>Fixed a typo in a message in <tt>parser_test.py</tt>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>1.6.0 (14 July 2012) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Added an optional timeout parameter to <tt>fetch()</tt>.
            Thanks to Richard Boulton for the suggestion and patch.
            </li>

            <li>Fixed a Python 3.x syntax error introduced in version 1.5.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>1.5.0 (16 June 2012) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where attempting to fetch from non-existent domain
                would raise a TypeError inside my Python 2/3-compatible 
                error-raising code. Now it correctly raises 
                <tt>urllib_error.URLError</tt>. I added a unit test for this 
                to <tt>parser_test.py</tt>. Thanks to Dave Challis for the 
                bug report.

                <p>Fixed the documentation (this file) about <tt>sitemap</tt> 
                which was deprecated in version 1.4 in favor of 
                <tt>sitemaps</tt>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>1.4.0 (8 Nov 2011) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where the parser only read one sitemap URL per
                <tt>robots.txt</tt> file. This was wrong; 
                <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#submit_robots">multiple sitemap URLs may be specified</a>.
                New code adds the attribute <tt>sitemaps</tt> and 
                deprecates <tt>sitemap</tt>. Thanks to Dan Lecocq for the 
                bug report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

	<li>1.3 (28 March 2010) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Added Python 3.1 support.</li>
	        <li>Fixed the license text in the code which was still referring 
	            to the old license. This code is BSD licensed.
	        </li>
	        <li>Replaced calls to <tt>map()</tt>
	            and <tt>filter()</tt> with list comprehensions.
	        </li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>1.2.2 (22 November 2009) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Fixed broken download URL that was being
	            submitted to PyPi (d'oh!).</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>1.2.1 (19 November 2009) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Changed references to <tt>email.utils</tt> to 
	            <tt>email_utils</tt> which
	            is friendlier to older Python versions. Thanks to Alex 
	            Bendig for the heads up.
	        </li>
	        <li>Changed from a Python to BSD license.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>1.2 (27 September 2009) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Renamed the <tt>Ruleset</tt> class to <tt>_Ruleset</tt> and 
	            moved it out of the <tt>RobotExclusionRulesParser</tt> class. 
	            This move allows parser instances to be pickled. Thanks
	            to Felipe H. for the bug report.
	        </li>
	        <li>Fixed an import problem (introduced in 0.9.6) that prevented
	            the module from running under Python 2.4.
	        </li>
	        <li>Added docstrings.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>1.1 (3 March 2009) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Switched to the Python license.</li>
	        <li>Added the <tt>RobotFileParserLookalike</tt> class to make
	            it easier for existing code to adopt this module.
	        </li>
	        <li>Updated doc and tests.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>1.0 (26 February 2009) &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Added support for GYM2008. Thanks to Roman Petrichev
	            for the path wildcard patch.</li>
	        <li>Expanded the tests and fixed the ones that were relying
	            on files on the Web that didn't exist any longer.
	        </li>
	        <li>Made the code more respectful of PEP 8 and a bit cleaner.</li>
	        <li>Added a setup.py.</li>
	        <li>Lots of documentation updates.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>0.9.6 (20 May 2008) &ndash; Several changes &ndash;
	    <ul>
	        <li>Added the <tt>response_code</tt> attribute.</li>
	        <li>Replaced the deprecated rfc822 module with email.utils.</li>
	        <li>Updated the references to robotstxt.org site which has been reorganized.</li>
	        <li>Fixed a bug where robots.txt files sent with an Expires header in the old
	            date format of C's <tt>asctime()</tt> would have their expiration date 
	            calculated incorrectly. Since only 3% of robots.txt files come with an 
	            Expires header and use of the old date format is rare, this bug probably 
	            affected very few people.
	        </li>
	    </ul>
	</li>

	<li>0.9.5 (21 January 2008) &ndash; <em>This version was mislabeled 0.9.4 in the code.</em>
	    Added a 100k limit to
		the amount of data read by a call to <tt>fetch()</tt> to protect against Webmasters
		who supply an ISO or some such instead of a robots.txt. (It happens...)
	</li>

	<li>0.9.4 (15 November 2007) &ndash; Added OSError to the list of 
		possible exceptions mentioned in this documentation. No code changes.
	</li>

	<li>0.9.3 (14 December 2006) &ndash; Added a list of exceptions to
	watch out for to this documentation. No code changes.
	</li>

	<li>0.9.3 (16 November 2006) &ndash; Added some calls to <tt>unicode</tt>
	to the top of <tt>is_allowed()</tt> to make it easier for callers to debug Unicode
	problems should they arise.
	</li>

	<li>0.9.2 (25 October 2006) &ndash; Changed <tt>_ParseContentTypeHeader()</tt>
	to accept quoted values in the parameter field of HTTP content type headers so that an encoding
	like <tt>charset="utf-8"</tt> is now interpreted properly.
	</li>

	<li>0.9.1 (22 October 2006) &ndash; Fixed a bug in the control character
	scrubbing that caused pipe (ASCII 0x7c) to be considered a control character.
	</li>

	<li>0.9 (10 October 2006) &ndash; Added code to scrub control
	characters (&lt; ASCII 0x20 and ASCII
	0x7f) from the user-agent and path fields so that the string representation of a parser
	is guaranteed not to contain any of these characters. This makes it easier to share
	the string with other programs (like a database) which are often allergic to things like
	embedded NULLs in strings. I added code to parser_test.py to challenge this new code.
	</li>

	<li>I bumped the version number up to .9 because the core of this module has been stable for
	a while now.
	</li>

	<li>0.8.1 (24 September 2006) &ndash; Made <tt>source_url</tt> read-only. This isn't a
	functional change, it just enforces what was formerly just conceptual.
	</li>
	<li>0.8.0 (14 April 2006) &ndash; Made <tt>_ParseContentTypeHeader()</tt> more robust when
	dealing with malformed Content-Type headers.
	</li>
	<li>0.7.3 (27 March 2006) &ndash; Fixed a bug where I sometimes referenced an unset request object.
	Added code to handle getdate_tz()'s undocumented ability to return None where the timezone
	offset should be.
	</li>
	<li>0.7.2 (15 March 2006) &ndash; Several changes &ndash;
		<ul>
		    <li>Fixed a big bug that was a result of me misinterpreting the spec with regards to
		        the handling of the default ('*') user-agent (big stoopid on my part).</li>
		    <li>Added code to handle LookupError and ValueError exceptions raised
		    from calls to <tt>unicode()</tt>. </li>
		    <li>Changed <tt>__str__()</tt> to return a UTF-8 encoded string so that it won't
		        fail when the robots.txt content is non-ASCII.
		    </li>
		    <li>Removed some redundant calls to <tt>.lower()</tt> in <tt>_ParseContentTypeHeader()</tt>.</li>
		    <li>Added a comment about BOMs.</li>
		    <li>Added more information to this document.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>0.7.1 (8 March 2006) &ndash; Minor bug fixes (nothing like real-world data to test on).</li>
	<li>0.7 (Feb 2006) &ndash; First version.</li>
</ul>
